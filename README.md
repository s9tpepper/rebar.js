# rebar.js - JavaScript Code Generation - WORK IN PROGRESS

Rebar.js is a code generation tool that runs on Node. It is a command line program
that tries to help take out some of the repetitive work out of the TDD/BDD coding
workflow by providing code generation commands that help quicken routine project
activities such as initial project structures, unit test and production JavaScript file
creation, Cucumber .feature and step definition files, and grunt.js build scaffolding.

Rebar.js is a work in progress, documentation will be posted on this page as
features are completed and Rebar.js is ready for usage.
